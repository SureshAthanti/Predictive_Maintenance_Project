# Aircraft Predictive Maintenance

## Goal 

The goal is is to predict the remaining useful component of life. The remaining useful life estimates are in the units if time (cycles/hours/mileage). 
We have used Linear and non - linear models to predict the Time To Failure of a machine.

## Conclusion

Damage propagation model/Predictive maintenance is very useful in many industries for estimating the maintenance period for in-service equipment. 

Our, solution is for the aircraft run-to-failure period estimation based on the simulated dataset. This analysis can be used in the aircraft or defense industries for better maintenance strategies.

As future work, we can implement the same models for estimating the Remaining Useful Life of certain parts with limited life before itâ€™s failure can be predicted by extending this approach for other parts.

The work can be extended with Neural Network Models to predict RUL based on input sensor measurements with larger datasets. So that optimized maintenance can be planned and downtime for the aircraft can be reduced.
